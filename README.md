The MultiBoard is a multifunction CNC control board focused around modularity. Based off of the great Smoothieware firmware combined with
removable high current Trinamic driver chips and modular machine connection options the MultiBoard makes the control of any machine possible. 

Soon I will be adding much more to this repository, keep a look out for updates!
